    Returns the absolute URI of the script being run in this
isolate.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the script argument on the command line is relative,
it is resolved to an absolute URI before fetching the script, and
this absolute URI is returned.
   </p>
   <p>
    URI resolution only does string manipulation on the script path, and this
may be different from the file system&#39;s path resolution behavior. For
example, a symbolic link immediately followed by &#39;..&#39; will not be
looked up.
