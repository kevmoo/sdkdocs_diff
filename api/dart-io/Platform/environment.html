    The returned environment is an unmodifiable map which content is
retrieved from the operating system on its first use.
   </p>

    Environment variables on Windows are case-insensitive. The map
returned on Windows is therefore case-insensitive and will convert
all keys to upper case. On other platforms the returned map is
a standard case-sensitive map.
