   Exit the Dart VM process immediately with the given exit code.
  </p>
  <p>
   This does not wait for any asynchronous operations to terminate. Using
   <a class="" href="dart-io/exit.html">
    exit
   </a>
   is therefore very likely to lose data.
  </p>
  <p>
   The handling of exit codes is platform specific.
  </p>
  <p>
   On Linux and OS X an exit code for normal termination will always
be in the range
   <code>
    0..255
   </code>
   . If an exit code outside this range is
set the actual exit code will be the lower 8 bits masked off and
treated as an unsigned value. E.g. using an exit code of -1 will
result in an actual exit code of 255 being reported.
  </p>
  <p>
   On Windows the exit code can be set to any 32-bit value. However
some of these values are reserved for reporting system errors like
crashes.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides this the Dart executable itself uses an exit code of
   <code>
    254
   </code>
   for reporting compile time errors and an exit code of
   <code>
    255
   </code>
   for
reporting runtime error (unhandled exception).
  </p>
  <p>
   Due to these facts it is recommended to only use exit codes in the
range
   <code>
    0..127
   </code>
   for communicating the result of running a Dart
program to the surrounding environment. This will avoid any
cross-platform issues.
