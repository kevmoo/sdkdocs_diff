   Locks the file or part of the file.
  </p>
  <p>
   By default an exclusive lock will be obtained, but that can be overridden
by the
   <code>
    mode
   </code>
   argument.
  </p>
  <p>
   Locks the byte range from
   <code>
    start
   </code>
   to
   <code>
    end
   </code>
   of the file, with the
byte at position
   <code>
    end
   </code>
   not included. If no arguments are
specified, the full file is locked, If only
   <code>
    start
   </code>
   is specified
the file is locked from byte position
   <code>
    start
   </code>
   to the end of the
file, no matter how large it grows. It is possible to specify an
explicit value of
   <code>
    end
   </code>
   which is past the current length of the file.
  </p>
  <p>
   To obtain an exclusive lock on a file it must be opened for writing.
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    NOTE
   </em>
   file locking does have slight differences in behavior across
platforms:
  </p>
  <p>
   On Linux and OS X this uses advisory locks, which have the
surprising semantics that all locks associated with a given file
are removed when
   <em>
    any
   </em>
   file descriptor for that file is closed by
the process. Note that this does not actually lock the file for
access. Also note that advisory locks are on a process
level. This means that several isolates in the same process can
obtain an exclusive lock on the same file.
  </p>
  <p>
   On Windows the regions used for lock and unlock needs to match. If that
is not the case unlocking will result in the OS error &#34;The segment is
already unlocked&#34;.
