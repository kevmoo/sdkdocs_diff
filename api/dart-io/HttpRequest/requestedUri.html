   <p>
    The returend URI is reconstructed by using http-header fields, to access
otherwise lost information, e.g. host and scheme.
   </p>
   <p>
    To reconstruct the scheme, first &#39;X-Forwarded-Proto&#39; is checked, and then
falling back to server type.
   </p>
   <p>
    To reconstruct the host, fisrt &#39;X-Forwarded-Host&#39; is checked, then &#39;Host&#39;
and finally calling back to server.
