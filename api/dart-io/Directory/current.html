    Sets the current working directory of the Dart process including
all running isolates. The new value set can be either a
    <a class="" href="dart-io/Directory-class.html">
     Directory
    </a>
    or a
    <a class="" href="dart-core/String-class.html">
     String
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    The new value is passed to the OS&#39;s system call unchanged, so a
relative path passed as the new working directory will be
resolved by the OS.
   </p>
   <p>
    Note that setting the current working directory is a synchronous
operation and that it changes the the working directory of
    <em>
     all
    </em>
    isolates.
   </p>
   <p>
    Use this with care - especially when working with asynchronous
operations and multiple isolates. Changing the working directory,
while asynchronous operations are pending or when other isolates
are working with the file system, can lead to unexpected results.
