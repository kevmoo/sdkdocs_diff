    Returns a Future that completes just before the window is about to
repaint so the user can draw an animation frame.
   </p>
   <p>
    If you need to later cancel this animation, use
    <a class="" href="dart-html/Window/requestAnimationFrame.html">
     requestAnimationFrame
    </a>
    instead.

   <p>
    The
    <a class="" href="dart-async/Future-class.html">
     Future
    </a>
    completes to a timestamp that represents a floating
point value of the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the page
started to load (which is also the timestamp at this call to
animationFrame).
   </p>
   <p>
    Note: The code that runs when the future completes should call
    <a class="" href="dart-html/Window/animationFrame.html">
     animationFrame
    </a>
    again for the animation to continue.
