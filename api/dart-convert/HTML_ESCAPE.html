   A
   <code>
    String
   </code>
   converter that converts characters to HTML entities.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is intended to sanitice text before inserting the text into an HTML
document. Characters that are meaningful in HTML are converted to
HTML entities (like
   <code>
    &amp;amp;
   </code>
   for
   <code>
    &amp;
   </code>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   The general converter escapes all characters that are meaningful in HTML
attributes or normal element context. Elements with special content types
(like CSS or JavaScript) may need a more specialized escaping that
understands that content type.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the context where the text will be inserted is known in more detail,
it&#39;s possible to omit escaping some characters (like quotes when not
inside an attribute value).
  </p>
  <p>
   The escaped text should only be used inside quoted HTML attributes values
or as text content of a normal element. Using the escaped text inside a
tag, but not inside a quoted attribute value, is still dangerous.
