   Provides at most the first

   Forwards the first
   <code>
    n
   </code>
   data events of this stream, and all error
events, to the returned stream, and ends with a done event.
  </p>
  <p>
   If this stream produces fewer than
   <code>
    count
   </code>
   values before it&#39;s done,
so will the returned stream.

  <p>
   Stops listening to the stream after the first
   <code>
    n
   </code>
   elements have been
received.
  </p>
  <p>
   Internally the method cancels its subscription after these elements. This
means that single-subscription (non-broadcast) streams are closed and
cannot be reused after a call to this method.
  </p>
  <p>
   The returned stream is a broadcast stream if this stream is.
For a broadcast stream, the events are only counted from the time
the returned stream is listened to.
