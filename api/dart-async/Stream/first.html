    Returns the first element of the stream.
   </p>
   <p>
    Stops listening to the stream after the first element has been received.
   </p>
   <p>
    Internally the method cancels its subscription after the first element.
This means that single-subscription (non-broadcast) streams are closed
and cannot be reused after a call to this getter.
   </p>
   <p>
    If an error event occurs before the first data event, the resulting future
is completed with that error.
   </p>
   <p>
    If this stream is empty (a done event occurs before the first data event),
the resulting future completes with a
    <a class="" href="dart-core/StateError-class.html">
     StateError
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Except for the type of the error, this method is equivalent to
    <code>
     this.elementAt(0)
    </code>
    .
