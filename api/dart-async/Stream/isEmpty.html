    Reports whether this stream contains any elements.

   <p>
    Stops listening to the stream after the first element has been received.
   </p>
   <p>
    Internally the method cancels its subscription after the first element.
This means that single-subscription (non-broadcast) streams are closed and
cannot be reused after a call to this getter.
