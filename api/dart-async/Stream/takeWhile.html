   The returned stream provides the same events as this stream as long
as
   <code>
    test
   </code>
   returns
   <code>
    true
   </code>
   for the event data. The stream is done
when either this stream is done, or when this stream first provides
a value that
   <code>
    test
   </code>
   doesn&#39;t accept.
  </p>
  <p>
   Stops listening to the stream after the accepted elements.
  </p>
  <p>
   Internally the method cancels its subscription after these elements. This
means that single-subscription (non-broadcast) streams are closed and
cannot be reused after a call to this method.
  </p>
  <p>
   The returned stream is a broadcast stream if this stream is.
For a broadcast stream, the events are only tested from the time
the returned stream is listened to.
