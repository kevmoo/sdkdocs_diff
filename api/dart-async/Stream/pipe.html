   Pipe the events of this stream into

  <p>
   The events of this stream are added to
   <code>
    streamConsumer
   </code>
   using
   <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamConsumer/addStream.html">
    StreamConsumer.addStream
   </a>
   .
The
   <code>
    streamConsumer
   </code>
   is closed when this stream has been successfully added
to it - when the future returned by
   <code>
    addStream
   </code>
   completes without an error.
  </p>
  <p>
   Returns a future which completes when the stream has been consumed
and the consumer has been closed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The returned future completes with the same result as the future returned
by
   <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamConsumer/close.html">
    StreamConsumer.close
   </a>
   .
If the adding of the stream itself fails in some way,
then the consumer is expected to be closed, and won&#39;t be closed again.
In that case the returned future completes with the error from calling
   <code>
    addStream
   </code>
   .
