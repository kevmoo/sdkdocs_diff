   Consumes the elements of
   <code>
    stream
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Listens on
   <code>
    stream
   </code>
   and does something for each event.
  </p>
  <p>
   Returns a future which is completed when the stream is done being added,
and the consumer is ready to accept a new stream.
No further calls to
   <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamConsumer/addStream.html">
    addStream
   </a>
   or
   <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamConsumer/close.html">
    close
   </a>
   should happen before the
returned future has completed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The consumer may stop listening to the stream after an error,
it may consume all the errors and only stop at a done event,
or it may be canceled early if the receiver don&#39;t want any further events.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the consumer stops listening because of some error preventing it
from continuing, it may report this error in the returned future,
otherwise it will just complete the future with
   <code>
    null
   </code>
   .
