   May return a future which completes when the stream is done cleaning up.
This can be used if the stream needs to release some resources
that are needed for a following operation,
for example a file being read, that should be deleted afterwards.
In that case, the file may not be able to be deleted successfully
until the returned future has completed.
  </p>
  <p>
   The future will be completed with a
   <code>
    null
   </code>
   value.
If the cleanup throws, which it really shouldn&#39;t, the returned future
will be completed with that error.

  <p>
   Returns
   <code>
    null
   </code>
   if there is no need to wait.
