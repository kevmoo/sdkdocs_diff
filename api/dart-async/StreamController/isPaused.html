    Whether the subscription would need to buffer events.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is the case if the controller&#39;s stream has a listener and it is
paused, or if it has not received a listener yet. In that case, the
controller is considered paused as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    A broadcast stream controller is never considered paused. It always
forwards its events to all uncanceled subscriptions, if any,
and let the subscriptions handle their own pausing and buffering.
