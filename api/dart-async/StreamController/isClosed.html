    Whether the stream controller is closed for adding more events.
   </p>
   <p>
    The controller becomes closed by calling the
    <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamSink/close.html">
     close
    </a>
    method.
New events cannot be added, by calling
    <a class="" href="dart-async/EventSink/add.html">
     add
    </a>
    or
    <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamController/addError.html">
     addError
    </a>
    ,
to a closed controller.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the controller is closed,
the &#34;done&#34; event might not have been delivered yet,
but it has been scheduled, and it is too late to add more events.
