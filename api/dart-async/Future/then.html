   Register callbacks to be called when this future completes.
  </p>
  <p>
   When this future completes with a value,
the
   <code>
    onValue
   </code>
   callback will be called with that value.
If this future is already completed, the callback will not be called
immediately, but will be scheduled in a later microtask.
  </p>
  <p>
   If
   <code>
    onError
   </code>
   is provided, and this future completes with an error,
the
   <code>
    onError
   </code>
   callback is called with that error and its stack trace.
The
   <code>
    onError
   </code>
   callback must accept either one argument or two arguments.
If
   <code>
    onError
   </code>
   accepts two arguments,
it is called with both the error and the stack trace,
otherwise it is called with just the error object.
  </p>
  <p>
   Returns a new
   <a class="" href="dart-async/Future-class.html">
    Future
   </a>
   which is completed with the result of the call to
   <code>
    onValue
   </code>
   (if this future completes with a value)
or to
   <code>
    onError
   </code>
   (if this future completes with an error).
  </p>
  <p>
   If the invoked callback throws,
the returned future is completed with the thrown error
and a stack trace for the error.
In the case of
   <code>
    onError
   </code>
   ,
if the exception thrown is
   <code>
    identical
   </code>
   to the error argument to
   <code>
    onError
   </code>
   ,
the throw is considered a rethrow,
and the original stack trace is used instead.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the callback returns a
   <a class="" href="dart-async/Future-class.html">
    Future
   </a>
   ,
the future returned by
   <code>
    then
   </code>
   will be completed with
the same result as the future returned by the callback.
  </p>
  <p>
   If
   <code>
    onError
   </code>
   is not given, and this future completes with an error,
the error is forwarded directly to the returned future.
  </p>
  <p>
   In most cases, it is more readable to use
   <a class="" href="dart-async/Future/catchError.html">
    catchError
   </a>
   separately, possibly
with a
   <code>
    test
   </code>
   parameter, instead of handling both value and error in a
single
   <a class="" href="dart-async/Future/then.html">
    then
   </a>
   call.
