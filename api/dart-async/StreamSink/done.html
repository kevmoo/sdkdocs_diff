    Return a future which is completed when the
    <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamSink-class.html">
     StreamSink
    </a>
    is finished.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the
    <code>
     StreamSink
    </code>
    fails with an error,
perhaps in response to adding events using
    <a class="" href="dart-async/EventSink/add.html">
     add
    </a>
    ,
    <a class="" href="dart-async/EventSink/addError.html">
     addError
    </a>
    or
    <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamSink/close.html">
     close
    </a>
    ,
the
    <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamSink/done.html">
     done
    </a>
    future will complete with that error.
   </p>
   <p>
    Otherwise, the returned future will complete when either:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     all events have been processed and the sink has been closed, or
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      the sink has otherwise been stopped from handling more events
  (for example by cancelling a stream subscription).
     </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
