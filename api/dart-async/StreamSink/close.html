   Tells the stream sink that no futher streams will be added.
  </p>
  <p>
   This allows the stream sink to complete any remaining work and release
resources that are no longer needed
  </p>
  <p>
   Returns a future which is completed when the stream sink has shut down.
If cleaning up can fail, the error may be reported in the returned future,
otherwise it completes with
   <code>
    null
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Returns the same future as
   <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamSink/done.html">
    done
   </a>
   .

  <p>
   The stream sink may close before the
   <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamSink/close.html">
    close
   </a>
   method is called, either due
to an error or because it is itself provding events to someone who has
stopped listening. In that case, the
   <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamSink/done.html">
    done
   </a>
   future is completed first,
and the
   <code>
    close
   </code>
   method will return the
   <code>
    done
   </code>
   future when called.
  </p>

   <a class="" href="dart-async/StreamConsumer/close.html">
    StreamConsumer.close
   </a>
   and
   <a class="" href="dart-async/EventSink/close.html">
    EventSink.close
   </a>
   which both mark their
object as not expecting any further events.
