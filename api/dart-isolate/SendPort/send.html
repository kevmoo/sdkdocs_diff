   Sends an asynchronous
   <code>
    message
   </code>
   through this send port, to its
corresponding
   <code>
    ReceivePort
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The content of
   <code>
    message
   </code>
   can be: primitive values (null, num, bool, double,
String), instances of
   <a class="" href="dart-isolate/SendPort-class.html">
    SendPort
   </a>
   , and lists and maps whose elements are any
of these. List and maps are also allowed to be cyclic.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the special circumstances when two isolates share the same code and are
running in the same process (e.g. isolates created via
   <a class="" href="dart-isolate/Isolate/spawn.html">
    Isolate.spawn
   </a>
   ), it
is also possible to send object instances (which would be copied in the
process). This is currently only supported by the dartvm.  For now, the
dart2js compiler only supports the restricted messages described above.
  </p>
  <p>
   The send happens immediately and doesn&#39;t block.  The corresponding receive
port can receive the message as soon as its isolate&#39;s event loop is ready
to deliver it, independently of what the sending isolate is doing.
