   <p>
    Get a Stream that fires events when AudioProcessingEvents occur.
This particular stream is special in that it only allows one listener to a
given stream. Converting the returned Stream
    <code>
     asBroadcast
    </code>
    will likely ruin
the soft-real-time properties which which these events are fired and can
be processed.
