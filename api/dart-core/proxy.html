   The annotation
   <code>
    @proxy
   </code>
   marks a class as implementing interfaces and members
dynamically through
   <code>
    noSuchMethod
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The annotation applies to any class. It is inherited by subclasses from both
superclass and interfaces.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a class is annotated with
   <code>
    @proxy
   </code>
   , or it implements any class that is
annotated, then the class is considered to implement any interface and
any member with regard to static type analysis. As such, it is not a static
type warning to assign the object to a variable of any type, and it is not
a static type warning to access any member of the object.
  </p>
  <p>
   This only applies to static type warnings. The runtime type of the object
is unaffected. It is not considered to implement any special interfaces at
runtime, so assigning it to a typed variable may fail in checked mode, and
testing it with the
   <code>
    is
   </code>
   operator will not work for any type except the
ones it actually implements.
  </p>
  <p>
   Tools that understand
   <code>
    @proxy
   </code>
   should tell the user if a class using
   <code>
    @proxy
   </code>
   does not override the
   <code>
    noSuchMethod
   </code>
   declared on
   <a class="" href="dart-core/Object-class.html">
    Object
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The intent of the
   <code>
    @proxy
   </code>
   notation is to create objects that implement a
type (or multiple types) that are not known at compile time. If the types
are known at compile time, a class can be written that implements these
types.
