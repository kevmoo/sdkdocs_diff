   <p>
    Get a hash code for this object.
   </p>
   <p>
    All objects have hash codes. Hash codes are guaranteed to be the
same for objects that are equal when compared using the equality
operator
    <code>
     ==
    </code>
    . Other than that there are no guarantees about
the hash codes. They will not be consistent between runs and
there are no distribution guarantees.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a subclass overrides
    <a class="" href="dart-core/Object/hashCode.html">
     hashCode
    </a>
    it should override the
equality operator as well to maintain consistency.
