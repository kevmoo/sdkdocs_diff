   Returns a string representation of (some of) the elements of
   <code>
    this
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Elements are represented by their own
   <code>
    toString
   </code>
   results.
  </p>
  <p>
   The default representation always contains the first three elements.
If there are less than a hundred elements in the iterable, it also
contains the last two elements.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the resulting string isn&#39;t above 80 characters, more elements are
included from the start of the iterable.
  </p>
  <p>
   The conversion may omit calling
   <code>
    toString
   </code>
   on some elements if they
are known to not occur in the output, and it may stop iterating after
a hundred elements.
