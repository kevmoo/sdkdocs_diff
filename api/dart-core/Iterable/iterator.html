    Returns a new
    <code>
     Iterator
    </code>
    that allows iterating the elements of this
    <code>
     Iterable
    </code>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Iterable classes may specify the iteration order of their elements
(for example
    <a class="" href="dart-core/List-class.html">
     List
    </a>
    always iterate in index order),
or they may leave it unspecified (for example a hash-based
    <a class="" href="dart-core/Set-class.html">
     Set
    </a>
    may iterate in any order).
   </p>
   <p>
    Each time
    <code>
     iterator
    </code>
    is read, it returns a new iterator,
which can be used to iterate through all the elements again.
The iterators of the same iterable can be stepped through independently,
but should return the same elements in the same order,
as long as the underlying collection isn&#39;t changed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Modifying the collection may cause new iterators to produce
different elements, and may change the order of existing elements.
A
    <a class="" href="dart-core/List-class.html">
     List
    </a>
    specifies its iteration order precisely,
so modifying the list changes the iteration order predictably.
A hash-based
    <a class="" href="dart-core/Set-class.html">
     Set
    </a>
    may change its iteration order completely
when adding a new element to the set.
   </p>
   <p>
    Modifying the underlying collection after creating the new iterator
may cause an error the next time
    <a class="" href="dart-core/Iterator/moveNext.html">
     Iterator.moveNext
    </a>
    is called
on that iterator.
Any
    <em>
     modifiable
    </em>
    iterable class should specify which operations will
break iteration.
