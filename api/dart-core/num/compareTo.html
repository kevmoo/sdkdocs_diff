   Compares this to

   Returns a negative number if
   <code>
    this
   </code>
   is less than
   <code>
    other
   </code>
   , zero if they are
equal, and a positive number if

  <p>
   The orderding represented by this method is a total ordering of
   <a class="" href="dart-core/num-class.html">
    num
   </a>
   values. All distinct doubles are non-equal, as are all distinct integers,
but integers are equal to doubles if they have the same numerical
value.
  </p>
  <p>
   For ordering, the double NaN value is considered equal to itself, and
greater than any numeric value (unlike its behavior in
   <code>
    operator==
   </code>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   The double value -0.0 is considered less than 0.0 (and the integer 0), but
greater than any non-zero negative value.
  </p>
  <p>
   Positive infinity is greater than any finite value (any value apart from
itself and NaN), and negative infinity is less than any other value.
  </p>
  <p>
   All other values are compared using their numeric value.
