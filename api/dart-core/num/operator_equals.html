   Test whether this value is numerically equal to
   <code>
    other
   </code>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   If both operands are doubles, they are equal if they have the same
representation, except that:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     zero and minus zero (0.0 and -0.0) are considered equal. They
both have the numerical value zero.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN. If either operand is
NaN, the result is always false.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   If one operand is a double and the other is an int, they are equal if
the double has an integer value (finite with no fractional part) and
   <code>
    identical(doubleValue.toInt(), intValue)
   </code>
   is true.
  </p>
  <p>
   If both operands are integers, they are equal if they have the same value.
  </p>
  <p>
   Returns false if
   <code>
    other
   </code>
   is not a
   <a class="" href="dart-core/num-class.html">
    num
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   Notice that the behavior for NaN is non-reflexive. This means that
equality of double values is not a proper equality relation, as is
otherwise required of
   <code>
    operator==
   </code>
   . Using NaN in, e.g., a
   <a class="" href="dart-collection/HashSet-class.html">
    HashSet
   </a>
   will fail to work. The behavior is the standard IEEE-754 equality of
doubles.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you can avoid NaN values, the remaining doubles do have a proper eqality
relation, and can be used safely.
  </p>
  <p>
   Use
   <a class="" href="dart-core/num/compareTo.html">
    compareTo
   </a>
   for a comparison that distinguishes zero and minus zero,
and that considers NaN values as equal.
