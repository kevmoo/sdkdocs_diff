   Test whether another object is equal to this function.
  </p>
  <p>
   System-created function objects are only equal to other functions.
  </p>
  <p>
   Two function objects are known to represent the same function if
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     It is the same object. Static and top-level functions are compile time
  constants when used as values, so referring to the same function twice
  always give the same object,
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     or if they refer to the same member method extracted from the same object.
  Extracting a member method as a function value twice gives equal, but
  not necessarily identical, function values.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Function expressions never give rise to equal function objects. Each time
a function expression is evaluated, it creates a new closure value that
is not known to be equal to other closures created by the same expression.
  </p>
  <p>
   Classes implementing
   <code>
    Function
   </code>
   by having a
   <code>
    call
   </code>
   method should have their
own
   <code>
    operator==
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    hashCode
   </code>
   depending on the object.
