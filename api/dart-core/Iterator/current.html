    Returns
    <code>
     null
    </code>
    if the iterator has not yet been moved to the first
element, or if the iterator has been moved past the last element of the
    <a class="" href="dart-core/Iterable-class.html">

    </a>
    .

   <p>
    The
    <code>
     current
    </code>
    getter should keep its value until the next call to
    <a class="" href="dart-core/Iterator/moveNext.html">
     moveNext
    </a>
    , even if an underlying collection changes.
After a successful call to
    <code>
     moveNext
    </code>
    , the user doesn&#39;t need to cache
the current value, but can keep reading it from the iterator.
