    The fully-qualified name for this Dart language entity.
   </p>
   <p>
    This name is qualified by the name of the owner. For instance,
the qualified name of a method &#39;method&#39; in class &#39;Class&#39; in
library &#39;library&#39; is &#39;library.Class.method&#39;.
   </p>
   <p>
    Returns a
    <a class="" href="dart-core/Symbol-class.html">
     Symbol
    </a>
    constructed from a string representing the
fully qualified name of the reflectee.
Let
    <em>
     o
    </em>
    be the
    <a class="" href="dart-mirrors/DeclarationMirror/owner.html">
     owner
    </a>
    of this mirror, let
    <em>
     r
    </em>
    be the reflectee of
this mirror, let
    <em>
     p
    </em>
    be the fully qualified
name of the reflectee of
    <em>
     o
    </em>
    , and let
    <em>
     s
    </em>
    be the simple name of
    <em>
     r
    </em>
    computed by
    <a class="" href="dart-mirrors/DeclarationMirror/simpleName.html">
     simpleName
    </a>
    .
The fully qualified name of
    <em>
     r
    </em>
    is the
concatenation of
    <em>
     p
    </em>
    , &#39;.&#39;, and
    <em>
     s
    </em>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Because an isolate can contain more than one library with the same name (at
different URIs), a fully-qualified name does not uniquely identify any
language entity.
