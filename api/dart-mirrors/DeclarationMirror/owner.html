    A mirror on the owner of this Dart language entity. This is the declaration
immediately surrounding the reflectee.
   </p>
   <p>
    For a library, the owner is
    <code>
     null
    </code>
    .
For a class declaration, typedef or top level function
or variable, the owner is the enclosing library.
For a mixin application
    <em>
     S with M
    </em>
    , the owner is the owner
of
    <em>
     M
    </em>
    .
For a constructor, the owner is the immediately enclosing class.
For a method, instance variable or
a static variable, the owner is the immediately enclosing class,
unless the class is a mixin application
    <em>
     S with M
    </em>
    , in which case
the owner is
    <em>
     M
    </em>
    . Note that
    <em>
     M
    </em>
    may be an invocation of a generic.
For a parameter, local variable or local function the owner is the
immediately enclosing function.
