    A mirror on the owner of this Dart language entity.
   </p>
   <p>
    The owner is the declaration immediately surrounding the reflectee:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     For a library, the owner is
     <code>
      null
     </code>
     .
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      For a class declaration, typedef or top level function or variable, the
  owner is the enclosing library.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     For a mixin application
     <code>
      S with M
     </code>
     , the owner is the owner of
     <code>
      M
     </code>
     .
    </li>
    <li>
     For a constructor, the owner is the immediately enclosing class.
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      For a method, instance variable or a static variable, the owner is the
  immediately enclosing class, unless the class is a mixin application
      <code>
       S with M
      </code>
      , in which case the owner is
      <code>
       M
      </code>
      . Note that
      <code>
       M
      </code>
      may be an
  invocation of a generic.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
      For a parameter, local variable or local function the owner is the
  immediately enclosing function.
     </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
