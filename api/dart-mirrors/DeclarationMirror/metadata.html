    A list of the metadata associated with this declaration.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let
    <em>
     D
    </em>
    be the declaration this mirror reflects.
If
    <em>
     D
    </em>
    is decorated with annotations
    <em>
     A1, ..., An
    </em>
    where
    <em>
     n &gt; 0
    </em>
    , then for each annotation
    <em>
     Ai
    </em>
    associated
with
    <em>
     D, 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n
    </em>
    , let
    <em>
     ci
    </em>
    be the constant object
specified by
    <em>
     Ai
    </em>
    . Then this method returns a list whose
members are instance mirrors on
    <em>
     c1, ..., cn
    </em>
    .
If no annotations are associated with
    <em>
     D
    </em>
    , then
an empty list is returned.
   </p>
   <p>
    If evaluating any of
    <em>
     c1, ..., cn
    </em>
    would cause a
compilation error
the effect is the same as if a non-reflective compilation error
had been encountered.
